The aim of this software is to provide a full featured 'motif finder' focused on the analysis of typical APTAMER selection results, ie. a list of FASTA formatted sequences.
Aptamers are short sequence of nucleotides or aminoacids (DNA, RNA, peptides, circular peptides and small proteins). In molecular biology, there are two main methods to select aptamers: SELEX and Phage Display. Both methods rely on the analysis of sequences to discriminate specifically enriched aptamers from background noise.
The input of this software is then a list of short sequences of DNA, RNA or peptides.
The lenght of such sequences is tipically in a range of 5 and 50 units. The sequences are composed exclusively by strings of alphabet characters.
